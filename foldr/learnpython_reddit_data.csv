I'm a mom learning python - give it to me straight,"Hello,

I'm 33, fresh mom who wants another kid asap and I've worked in corporates as a people manager. Sadly, I didn't make this decision before but I would love to get into IT. I started learning python, doing the 100 days of python course by Angela Yu and I'm enjoying myself. 
The hard part is that I don't have that much time for it. I manage to do a few hours weekly and that is what I need to finish only one day in the course (currently day 25).

Am I crazy and wasting my time doing this? Will I ever get some junior entry role at this stage? How will I continue learning with this tempo? Give it to me straight.",287,223,2025-07-03 23:05:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1lr29yv/im_a_mom_learning_python_give_it_to_me_straight/,0.067,0.825,0.108,0.8042,Positive,2025-07-03

I'm super annoyed and taking it out on learnpython,"I've been a senior level software engineer for over 10 years. I have a ton of experience with multiple languages. I've been doing a lot of hard stuff for a very long time. I asked a twitter question to a pretty well-known person in the area I work in the other day, and he got really huffy, assumed that I had no idea what I was doing, told me to not ever do what I was asking about, and told me to go find a different job because I'm not competent to do the one I'm at right now. Never even asked why I was trying to do things a certain way, and just assumed that I was a n00b causing trouble.

&#x200B;

It made me really fucking angry. And it also made me think about how we deal with people we don't know, make assumptions based on questions, and tend to talk shit to people who aren't a part of our in-circle. About how things that people have done for a long time tend to get easier and how we forget how much we didn't know when we were getting started.

&#x200B;

So, I'm taking all my anger at that person out on this sub. I'm going to spend all day tomorrow answering all the questions I possibly can on learnpython in the kindest way I can and with a mentoring attitude where I'll try to understand where you're coming from, what you're trying to achieve, what might be the best way to get to it, and maybe a little extra handholding along the way.

&#x200B;

Be the change you want to see, right?

&#x200B;

Ask me anything about python and anything related to python. I'll spend 12 hours tomorrow answering every question I can.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: man, I was 50/50 on this post getting thrashed by the mods for being a rant. I'm so happy this is getting a lot of responses!

&#x200B;

First of all, thank you to all of you well-wishers encouraging me to not take it so hard. I do take it hard, and that's why I'm trying to resist and do something different with my frustration. To the person who said there needs to be more people like me in the world . . . thanks. That made my day.

&#x200B;

Here are some caveats about my approach: I am not a computer scientist. I don't come from that background. Many of my opinions are not orthodox. I spent the first 20 of my professional life as a classical violinist and music theory teacher. My first technology job was after I read a book on SQL, and my first 3 jobs were nothing but writing SQL. So a lot of my background has come from a data-centric place. It's nice that data is a big thing now! Over the last 13 years though, I've learned python and other languages mostly the hard way, but I've also done a ton of reading academic textbooks because that's how I grew up and learned music theory. So there's going to be some answers where I dive deep into computer science theory and practice and programming language design. Anything I say that isn't verbatim code is just one person's opinion. My word is not gospel. But it's what I have to offer, and I've thought about it a lot.

&#x200B;

I hope I can be really useful answering questions tomorrow and truly kind and helpful to everyone.

Trying to learnPython,"I work as a manual tester and to move forward in my career I need to start learning python.

Python is a godsend for work,"I wanted to just thank the community for everything here.  Its a real tool to have in your arsenal when things get tough.  Today was the first day I put it into use and it was all due to lurking around this subreddit from people helping out others.   

  


My manger felt like pissing me off at work right before the weekend today giving me a huge workload come 4PM.  I was tasked to combine a lot of information with multiple excel sheets that were not formatted alike and he wanted a report by 5PM.  I guess he was thinking I would be manually doing this by opening up each sheet and copying and pasting the information together.  Little did he know I've been reading about python and learning on the side.  The pandas library immediately sprung into my head saying this is going to be easy - dump the raw data frame clean it and merge it together afterwards.  I was not confident writing my own code but poking around with some help from chat gpt plus a bit of self knowledge i was able to finish it in 20 minutes.  



Funniest thing was after I finished, I sat there pretending to go over emails and he came by asking ""Are you going to be able to provide me the report?  Looks like you will have to stay late to finish this"" with his smug ass look on his face.  He left early and I sent him what he needed right after he was gone.

"I'm a 40 year old Truck Driver learning Python, my thoughts so far...","I have spent most of my free time over the last year learning Python, C++, HTML\\CSS, and taking a very basic cybersecurity course.

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and a big Thank You to /r/learnpython,"In March, 2020, my wife and I started a small business. Without going too deep into the details, we are a small publisher who publishes specialty documents. We distribute in both paper and PDF formats.

Two weeks after we started our business, the world shut down. We somehow survived that period, and I spent the time of the shutdown learning Python. This sub, /r/learnpython, was the best resource I found for learning.

I sorted /r/learnpython by top of all time, then read every link among the first several hundred in the sub. It took months to work through them all, but it was tremendously helpful at getting me started.

The learning process was quick for me, because I worked full time as a software developer for 20+ years, writing C/UNIX code (thus my account name.) Those years of C helped a great deal in learning Python. Some things were difficult to get used to, principle among them is semantic indentation. It makes sense now, but didn't at first. My fingers wanted to add ; { and } all over the place.

The first script I wrote processed incoming orders. The products we rent and sell are complex and expensive, so our order forms are complex. After the customer places an order on our website, it is sent by the Squarespace server to us as an email that contains about 40 key:value pairs in a text file. Like this:

Name: Bart Simpson

Organization: Springfield Elementary

Date Materials Requested: 11/14/2024

The script parses the email, then creates a word document that contains a license for either the rental or the purchase, and another word document that is an invoice for the order. To this day, this script is the biggest time saver in the system. It reduced about 20 minutes of messy mouse diddling down to less than a minute.

After the success of that script, I began automating everything in Python. The system consists of about 10 scripts that process orders, track orders, process credit card payments by communicating with Stripe via its API, communicate with Brevo (email marketing) via its API, add licensing information to every page in the PDF files being rented or sold, alert me to upcoming shipments, help process shipments, and several utilities. 

When I decided to continue with the automation, it became clear that I needed to abandon the first script I wrote. It was dubious at best in terms of the quality of its code. It worked, but was ugly. When writing C in the past, I used C data structures almost like objects, so abstracting our processes into objects was straightforward to accomplish. I rewrote it, and I'm glad I did.

At first, I used an Excel spreadsheet for storing orders and customer data, because that's how I tracked it prior to automating. It soon became clear that a SQL database would be a better route, so I downloaded MySQL, and began storing our data in a SQL database and reading and writing it via MySQL's Python API. SQL allowed all sorts of new capabilities to be easily added to the system.

The user interface consists of a series of Windows Desktop shortcuts. To process an order, I copy the email to the clipboard, then double click on Process Order, which reads the clipboard, then processes the order. Other shortcuts include Approve Rental, Process Payment, Ship, Look Up Order, and Prepare PDFs.

I have taken to calling my system Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, because like Dick Van Dyke's character in that movie, I'm the only one who knows how this all works. Since I am also the only one who will maintain it, it was designed for maximum maintainability, following many of the practices I used while writing C. Lengthy, descriptive variable names are a favorite technique of mine. 

The system now consists of about 5,000 lines of Python. I can't even imagine how many lines of C it would take to do all this. I'm glad to have built Chitty using Python.

Thanks, /r/learnpython. You have been a wonderful help to me many times.",96,8,2024-11-18 21:56:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1gufbbc/chitty_chitty_bang_bang_and_a_big_thank_you_to/,0.029,0.849,0.122,0.9971,Positive,2024-11-18
